Mitigation: Servers are currently embedded with myriad protections requisite in inhibiting outside access from admittance into systems.
Systems are inaccessible via the internet, inbound traffic is blocked by a B1 firewall, DISA whitelist and explicit ACL's.
Additional control measures include native configuration protections; TCP wrappers lock down systems to specific subnets, and secure shell
connections are locked down by exclusive allow-groups accessible only by approved ciphers, and physical access is secured by X.509 lock and swipe access.
Authentication access is secured by DISA compliant password strengths and lengths, and permissions to critical / key configuration files are accessible
only by the system administration team which is composed of known and verified personnel therefore limiting the vulnerability surface.
Vulnerability cannot be changed without significant impact to production or operations.  In addition automation clients such as HBSS/HIPS, AIDE,
NETIQ, and SYSLOG monitor and control purview of anomalies in pre-established baselines.
